Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is the name of the project. This is a pretty popular game that is also fairly simple. It's a two-player game, actually. A board with n x n squares is used in this game. It's 3 by 3 squares in our game. The purpose of Tic-Tac-Toe is for one of the players to get three identical symbols in a row on a 3 x 3 grid - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. With his opponent, a player can pick between two symbols; in most games, "X" and "O" are used. If the first player selects "X," the second player must select "O," and vice versa.

Features

This game is coded in C language in an open source software. This game doesn’t require much of software specification for the game to be played. It is compactible in any platform.  	

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his symbol (may be “X” or “O”) and his aim is to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions:

1) Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game.
1) Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.
1) In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, the game results a tie.
1) Hence there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins or it’s a tie.
1) The player could look onto the hints for the placing the correct symbols but this could reduce their points from the score table.
1) The player could see and compare others score and could level up the league.
1) The player could exit in between anytime of the game. 
1) The player could chat with other players using the chatting system.

PROBLEM SPECIFICATION

` `Tic-Tac-Toe game has 9 cells for a 3x3 grid. The two players with their respective marks as ‘X’ and ‘O’ are required to place their marks in their turns one by one. Once the cell is occupied by a mark it cannot be used again. The game is won if the agent is able to make a row or column or a diagonal occupied completely with their respective marks. The game terminates once the winning situation is gained or the cells are fully occupied. The problem specification for this game is given below: Problem: Given a 4x4 grid, the agents has to find the optimal cell to fill with respective marks.  


Goals

` `To find the optimal cell to fill with respective marks and in order to win the game, the cell must be filled such that one of the following criteria is satisfied: 

- A row is completely filled by a mark ‘X’ or ‘O’.
- A diagonal is completely filled by a mark ‘X’ or ‘O’.
- A column is completely filled by a mark ‘X’ or ‘O’.

Conclusion

As we construct our project at a very low level, we will be able to implement it in the future after making various changes and alterations. So here are the changes that can be made to our project:

One improvement that can be made in the future is to incorporate the fingerprints of the people whose addresses are input. Another big adjustment that can be made to this project is to include the photos of the individual whose address is supplied. We can also add or remove personal information.
